# Cluster deployment quick start

Build the three cluster binaries and launch a local cluster:

```bash
./scripts/build_release.sh
./scripts/cluster_local_example.sh bootstrap --root /tmp/lavik-cluster
```

The script creates three Meta nodes, two primary/replica Groups, four fresh
1 GiB Data files, and waits until the cluster is ready. `--root` must not
already exist. Use `--data-size 100G` to change the file size, or
`--bin-dir /path/to/build` to use another build directory.

Verify that clients can follow slot redirects:

```bash
redis-cli -c -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6371 SET greeting 'hello from Lavik cluster'
redis-cli -c -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6372 GET greeting
```

The generated manifest is at `/tmp/lavik-cluster/cluster.toml`; use it as the
starting point for a multi-host deployment. Replace every loopback address
with a stable reachable IP, keep each Meta and Data directory on persistent
storage, and start the same generated process roles on their assigned hosts.
All three initial Meta members use the same manifest. For normal deployment,
place Meta voters and a Group's primary/replica on separate hosts.

Useful commands:

```bash
./scripts/cluster_local_example.sh status --root /tmp/lavik-cluster
./scripts/cluster_local_example.sh down --root /tmp/lavik-cluster
./scripts/cluster_local_example.sh up --root /tmp/lavik-cluster
```

Run `up` without `bootstrap` after a restart; it retains the existing Data and
Meta state. Do not run `init` or `create` again for an existing cluster.

For TLS, Meta membership changes, or controlled failover, use the focused
[Meta control-plane runbook](meta-control-plane.md).
