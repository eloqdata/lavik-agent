# Shutdown index checkpoints

## Role and authority

A shutdown index checkpoint is an optional, one-use cache of the in-memory
top-level indexes. It reduces restart disk traffic; it does not replace
ordinary records or change command durability. Checkpoint loading validates
the serialized index structure, while the referenced ordinary record body is
validated lazily when it is read. A structurally valid checkpoint can therefore
restore a location whose later value read reports media corruption even when a
cold body scan would have reported that corruption during startup.
`shutdown-checkpoint yes` enables creation at clean shutdown and use at the
next startup. The CLI spelling is `--shutdown-checkpoint`; the default is
disabled. The startup value decides whether recovery consumes an existing
checkpoint because CONFIG is not available until recovery completes. Once the
server is online, `CONFIG SET shutdown-checkpoint yes|no` atomically changes
whether the next clean shutdown creates a checkpoint; `CONFIG GET` reports the
current process-local value.

Checkpoint construction starts only after request admission has stopped,
accepted requests have drained, and the control and replication layers have
joined every task that can mutate storage. Each worker first resets every
active stream (including an otherwise empty header), seals and flushes its
records, drains storage maintenance, and reaches a shutdown barrier. Worker 0
then runs transaction cleaning to a fixed point regardless of the online
cleaner cooldown: committed transaction-tagged winners are relocated to
durable ordinary records and the old transaction generations are retired.
That work can create new staged records, so all workers perform a second
seal/drain round and meet a second barrier. A final locked check rejects the
checkpoint if expiration, flush work, or a runtime storage failure appeared
behind either freeze. There is no online checkpoint flow. The build is
therefore O(current index entries), including reading complete keys that are
not retained inline; it does not scan obsolete record versions.

After request admission is closed and all accepted requests have drained, the
shutdown thread snapshots the runtime atomic once before publishing the flush
request. Every worker therefore observes the same latched decision and either
all enter or all skip the checkpoint barriers. A CONFIG update completed before
that drain affects the shutdown; no update can enter after the drain.

## Durable representation and publication

Four values at the end of mirrored epoch metadata form the checkpoint root:

- the monotonically increasing published generation;
- the highest consumed generation;
- the expected checkpoint block count;
- the expected checkpoint index-entry count.

These fields and the checkpoint block kinds directly extend development
storage format version 1. There is no compatibility decoder. Incompatible
ordinary-record layouts require clearing existing media; a checkpoint-only
layout change uses a new chunk-layout discriminator so the next startup rejects
the transient snapshot and falls back to the still-authoritative
ordinary-record scan. Each root copy participates in the existing per-page A/B
generation and CRC32C protocol on every device.

Each device also has a checkpoint bitmap parallel to its allocation bitmap,
with one bit per physical block and the same independently checksummed A/B page
scheme. It is a discovery index, not allocation authority: a set bit only asks
the loader to inspect that block, and the allocation bitmap plus the block's
own header still determine whether it is a matching candidate. The bitmap adds
fixed metadata space but does not reserve checkpoint data blocks or require a
contiguous block range. Its raw payload is `ceil(capacity_blocks / 8)` bytes;
the A/B copies consume twice that amount plus page headers (32 MiB at the
per-device 1 PiB limit).

Each worker serializes three chunk kinds into ordinary 8 MiB checkpoint blocks.
Its single capacity chunk contains the exact entry count for every owned
partition and logical-database index, including empty indexes. The complete
directory fits in one block even with one worker. Startup uses these counts to
allocate final index bucket tables before it installs keys; the directory is
also a completeness check independent of how index entries happen to be split
across blocks.
Index chunks contain the complete key, physical record location, database,
logical type and size, expiry and shielding state, and any extent manifest.
Their 48-byte fixed entry header packs the 43-bit block id with the low 21 bits
of its allocation epoch, and packs aligned offset, aligned length, owner,
database, type, and flags into another word. The remaining epoch bits retain
the complete runtime reuse horizon. The final word packs key length, extent
count, and logical partition into 32, 18, and 14 bits. Persisting the already
validated partition lets recovery route an entry without recalculating its
Redis slot, while the chunk CRC and partition-to-shard check protect the cached
routing metadata. Entries inherit the partition replication epoch that is
already durable in mirrored epoch metadata; repeating it per key would add 8
GB of checkpoint I/O per billion keys. Entry bounds come from the chunk and
field lengths, and expiry is stored only when present. The format stores each
key's SipHash digest and the checkpoint-wide random seed that gives it meaning.
A successful clean restart adopts that seed before constructing any index and
consumes the stored digests without hashing every key again.
Successive clean checkpoints retain the seed; a cold scan without a usable
checkpoint can choose a fresh process seed because ordinary records do not
depend on it. Retaining the seed avoids restart CPU at the cost of adding eight
checkpoint bytes per key and not rotating collision-flooding entropy at every
clean restart; the seed remains local storage metadata and is never exposed in
the Redis or replication protocols.

Block-accounting chunks contain one entry for every live ordinary or extent
block owned by the shard, not one entry per key. Each entry stores the block
identity, owner, aggregate live bytes, and the extra extent identity needed to
validate a manifest against its physical header. The dense runtime block table
is the authority for ordinary-block aggregates. While performing the required
index serialization pass, the builder aggregates the sparse extent manifests
because extent identity deliberately does not occupy every runtime
`BlockState`, and an extent's recovery owner can differ from its key-index
shard. The restored extent entry therefore resolves its physical owner only
after the block-header scan.
Capacity, index, and accounting chunks share the checkpoint block kind,
generation, bitmap, publication lifecycle, and payload CRC; an explicit
chunk-kind field selects their entry layout.

Each shard builder alternates two aligned 8 MiB buffers. Once one buffer has
been encoded and submitted, the worker builds the next chunk in the other
while the first write remains in flight; it waits only before reusing a slot.
Both writes must complete before that shard enters the publication barrier.
Abandoning a shard after a serialization or I/O error leaves any submitted
buffer owned by its completion, so asynchronous device access cannot outlive
the DMA memory.

Publication order is:

```text
write every checkpoint capacity, index, and accounting block
write the checkpoint bitmap and synchronize data plus bitmap once per device
publish the generation and expected counts through the root on every device
```

The shard-build barrier waits for every block write completion before bitmap
publication starts. Each device's bitmap synchronization is also the durability
barrier for all checkpoint blocks written through any worker's file handle or
SPDK qpair on that device. The barrier runs even when the bitmap bytes are
unchanged because a reused block id can hold a newer checkpoint generation.

Until the final step completes, new blocks are unpublished acceleration state.
A partial or failed build never changes the published generation. Its bitmap
bits may remain as false positives, but the old root generation cannot select
the new block headers. Insufficient foreground space, an index entry larger
than one checkpoint block, transaction cleanup that cannot quiesce or relocate
its winners, or I/O failure causes this shutdown's checkpoint attempt to fail
without changing the durability of ordinary or transaction records. A tagged
winner observed by shard serialization is an invariant check for incomplete
cleanup, not a representation supported by the checkpoint. Checkpoint
allocation does not consume the defrag reserve and does not wait for online
reclamation.

After successful root publication, the production server arms a process-exit
only finalization path. Each runtime worker first drains I/O, closes its
io_uring or SPDK backend, and destroys detached coroutine frames as usual. Its
storage finalizer can then release ownership of the worker store without
walking every index entry; the process exits after the workers join and the OS
reclaims that address space in bulk through an explicit `_Exit` boundary.
AddressSanitizer builds never arm this shortcut: they retain ordinary
destruction and normal process return so LeakSanitizer still performs its
exit-time scan. The shortcut is also never armed when checkpoint publication
or the shutdown flush fails, and it cannot be used by an embedding that intends
to reuse the storage engine in the same process.

## Startup consumption and fallback

Preparation compares root copies from every device. A usable root must be
identical across the storage set, name an unconsumed generation, contain
plausible expected counts, and have valid checkpoint-bitmap pages. Before
reading the checkpoint, worker 0 persists `consumed_generation = generation`
to every device. If this startup later crashes, another startup cannot reuse a
snapshot that predates the failed process's runtime writes.

The loader requires the same worker count that created the checkpoint, then
all recovery workers walk disjoint, topology-aware stripes of its set bits.
SPDK workers touch only devices for which they own a qpair; io_uring workers
stripe the complete storage set. A false positive is ignored unless the
allocated block has a self-validating checkpoint header for the selected
generation. For matching blocks a 12 KiB prefix read validates and classifies
the block header and chunk header. Scanners then read the capacity chunks in
full and rendezvous before any key is installed. Startup requires exactly one
capacity chunk per worker, exactly one declaration per partition and database,
and a declared sum equal to the root entry count. Worker 0 distributes the
validated capacities, then all workers allocate their own index tables in
parallel. A second rendezvous publishes a uniform fallback decision before any
body can be installed if a declared capacity cannot be represented. Physical
allocator exhaustion is process-fatal rather than a fallback condition. Every
nonempty `ScanHashMap` receives the same final power-of-two bucket count and
75-percent target it would have after normal growth.

After that allocation barrier, each scanner validates block identity and
allocation epoch, generation, shard, bounds, entry counts, and CRC32C payload
checksums. Before those body reads, the prefix results redistribute every index
and accounting block to its durable shard. That owner reads, decodes, and
installs the block locally, avoiding a cross-worker decoded batch. This is
always accessible on io_uring because every worker opens every path. On SPDK,
checkpoint preparation verifies that the unchanged topology still gives the
shard owner a qpair for the block's controller; otherwise the checkpoint falls
back instead of silently restoring the old cross-worker path. Each owner
double-buffers checkpoint reads: after a block completes I/O it submits the
next block before decoding and installing the current one. I/O, decoding, and
index construction therefore proceed concurrently across owners. After the
whole payload passes CRC32C, each index entry is bounds- and semantics-checked,
its stored partition is checked against the chunk shard, and it is installed
directly from the pinned I/O buffer. Key bytes are copied only into their final
index nodes; there is neither an owning decoded batch, a Redis-slot
recalculation, nor a second chunk pass. Because the frozen checkpoint contains
exactly one
final winner per logical key, successful loading inserts those entries without
the multi-version arbitration used by the ordinary record scan. If a later
entry is invalid, the already installed valid prefix is marked as a checkpoint
winner and participates in the same authoritative cold-scan merge as prefixes
from earlier blocks. An owner therefore holds at most two 8 MiB buffers plus
final index state, so temporary entry memory remains bounded by worker count
rather than key count. Barriers reduce the per-scanner block,
index-entry, accounting-entry, capacity, and shard results. Block and
index-entry totals must exactly match the root, every worker must have all
three chunk kinds represented, and each installed index size must equal its
capacity declaration. The published total block count makes a missing chunk
detectable without adding another root field. If a block or the final
completeness check fails, startup disables ordinary-body skipping and performs
the full record scan. Entries
from already validated checkpoint blocks remain installed and participate in
the normal winner merge; the full scan supplies every missing key.

After the one load attempt, startup writes an all-zero checkpoint bitmap before
the parallel storage scan. On success, every matching index block is already
resident; its allocation bit is also cleared and its block ID enters the
allocator's cold-free pool. Stale, partial, or invalid checkpoint blocks not
selected by the bitmap and root are recognized during the normal header scan
and reclaimed through the same allocation-bitmap lifecycle. The consumed root
makes interruption of either clearing operation safe. A checkpoint-bitmap
clear I/O failure is reported but does not block authoritative record recovery;
the consumed root still prevents reuse.

With a valid checkpoint, recovery still scans the allocation bitmap and reads
the two header pages of every remaining allocated block. It reads transaction
block bodies to reconstruct durable commit evidence and extent headers for
identity validation, but skips the 8 MiB bodies of ordinary record blocks. Its
disk work is:

```text
O(allocated block headers + checkpoint bytes + transaction block bytes)
```

Recovery still walks the rebuilt winner indexes once to charge live roots and
extents to physical block owners after a cold scan. A successful checkpoint
load instead restores the persisted block-accounting table after the
block-header scan establishes runtime owners. Each absolute value is installed
once; a duplicate table entry or a mismatch with the scanned block identity is
a checkpoint failure. This removes both the second winner-index walk and the
per-key hash aggregation formerly performed while decoding the checkpoint.
The speedup still does not make startup independent of index-entry or allocated
block count: every checkpoint key must be decoded and every allocated block
header must be scanned.

The version-1 chunk layout is replaced in place rather than decoded through a
compatibility path. A checkpoint with an earlier header size or layout
discriminator is rejected before any key body is installed and falls back to
the authoritative record scan; ordinary record media is unchanged.
